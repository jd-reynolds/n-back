# n-back
*A game to exercise working memory*

### How to play
* The buffer is a list of numbers. 
* It is ordered chronologically (newest numbers first), and has a fixed size.
* When a new number is added to a full buffer, the oldest number is kicked out.
* Numbers will appear on screen and be added to the buffer.
* Indicate if the newest numbers are equal to the oldest numbers in the buffer, by entering either:
  > [m] for memory
  
  > [n] for no

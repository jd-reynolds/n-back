# n-back
A game to exercise working memory.

How to play:
  The buffer is a list of numbers. 
  It is ordered chronologically (newest numbers first), and has a fixed size.
  When a new number is added to a full buffer, the oldest number is kicked out.
  Numbers will appear on screen and be added to the buffer.
  Indicate if the newest numbers are equal to the oldest numbers in the buffer, by entering either:
  [m] for memory
  [n] for no
